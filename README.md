# IntransigentMS automated launcher/updater

## DEPRECATED

This is the old launcher used for the IntransigentMS Maplestory private server.

It checks if any updates are available since the last time the user updates,
installs the game if it isn't already installed, and allows users to bypass
updates or force check for updates if they wish.

The Google Drive API is used to fetch the relevant file(s) from Google Drive.
